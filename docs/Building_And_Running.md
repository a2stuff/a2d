## Build Instructions

Cross-development on a Unix-like system. Tested on macOS 10.15 and Linux Ubuntu Xenial 16.04.

Fetch, build, and install [cc65](http://cc65.github.io/cc65/):

```
git clone https://github.com/cc65/cc65
make -C cc65 ca65 ld65 avail
```

A very recent version of cc65 will be required, as recent compiler features and symbols from `asminc/apple2.inc` are used, and these change fairly often.

Fetch and build Apple II DeskTop:

```
git clone https://github.com/a2stuff/a2d
cd a2d
make
```

This will build all targets, including DeskTop itself, desk accessories, and preview accessories, and the optional Selector app.

## Getting DeskTop Onto Your Apple II

There are a handful of approaches for getting the files on your real or virtual Apple II.

### Option #1: Create a Disk Image

> Useful with ADTPro, solid-state drives like Floppy Emu, or emulators.

To produce a ProDOS disk image, install and build [Cadius](https://github.com/mach-kernel/cadius):

```
git clone https://github.com/mach-kernel/cadius
make -C cadius && make -C cadius install
```

Then run: `make package`

This will generate: `A2DeskTop-..._800k.2mg` and `.hdv` (800k images containing the full application) and `A2DeskTop-..._140k_disk1.po` and `A2DeskTop-..._140k_disk2.po` (the files split into two 140k images). The version (e.g. `alpha30`) and language (e.g. `en`) are defined in `config.inc`.

Mount these disk images in your emulator, or transfer them to real floppies with [ADTPro](http://adtpro.com/), then follow the install instructions below.

### Option #2: Install to an Existing Disk Image

> Useful with solid-state drives like Floppy Emu, or emulators.

Build and install [Cadius](https://github.com/mach-kernel/cadius) (instructions above)

Set these environment variables:

```sh
INSTALL_IMG=/path/to/image/file.2mg     # e.g. ~/Documents/hd.2mg
INSTALL_PATH=/prodos/directory          # e.g. /HD/A2.DESKTOP
```

Then run: `make install`

This will create the target ProDOS directory if necessary, then copy the built files in, overwriting any existing files.

After building and installing, you can use `bin/setopt sel` and `bin/setopt nosel` to toggle whether Selector starts or not, and `bin/setopt ram` and `bin/setopt noram` to toggle whether DeskTop is copied to a RAMCard or not. These can be controlled within DeskTop using the Startup Options control panel, but being able to toggle these on the command line is useful during development.

### Option #3: Mount Folder in Virtual ]\[

> Useful with the Virtual ]\[ emulator

If you use [Virtual \]\[](http://www.virtualii.com/) as your emulator, you can skip creating a disk image.

After building, run: `make mount`

This will copy the built files into the `mount/` directory  with appropriate file types/auxtypes set. Run Virtual ]\[ and use the **Media** > **Mount Folder as ProDOS Disk...** menu item, then select the `mount/` folder. A new ProDOS volume called `/MOUNT` will be available, containing DeskTop.

### Option #4: Build ShrinkIt file

If you have a workflow amenable to ShrinkIt disk images, first install `nulib2`, then run `make shk`. This will create an `A2D.SHK` file.

### Other

If you need to copy the files some other way (e.g. via [CiderPress](http://a2ciderpress.com/)), it's probably easiest to transfer the files from the disk images created by `make package` as they will have the appropriate ProDOS file types and aux types.


## Install Instructions

Apple II DeskTop works best on a mass storage device. Once you have the files accessible on your Apple, transfer them to your hard disk. It's best to create a top level `A2.DESKTOP` directory and copy the files/folders into it, with the following structure:

```
   Name                   Type  AuxType

   /HD/
     A2.DESKTOP/          DIR
       DESKTOP.SYSTEM     SYS
       MODULES/           DIR
         DESKTOP2         $F1   $0000
         DISK.COPY        $F1   $0000
         SELECTOR         $F1   $0000
       DESK.ACC/          DIR
         CALCULATOR       $F1   $0641
         EYES             $F1   $0641
         CONTROL.PANELS/  DIR
           DATE           $F1   $0641
           SYSTEM.SPEED   $F1   $0641
           ...
         ...
       PREVIEW/           DIR
         SHOW.FONT.FILE   $F1   $0641
         SHOW.IMAGE.FILE  $F1   $0641
         ...
       EXTRAS/            DIR
         UNSHRINK         SYS
         ...
```

## Running

Invoke `DESKTOP.SYSTEM` to launch the app. By default, DeskTop will launch. You can use the control panel Startup Options to configure Selector to start instead, which will show a dialog containing any shortcuts you have configued in DeskTop, for faster access to programs.
