Note that the desk accessories from version 1.2 will not work with older versions
of Apple II DeskTop/MouseDesk, due to dependence on new APIs.

The Show Text File DA is now part of the file preview functionality (see below).

### File Preview

Text, graphics, and font files with the correct file types can be
previewed without leaving DeskTop; select the file icon and then select
**File > Open**, or double-click the file icon.

* Text files must be type TXT ($04).
* Graphics files must be type FOT ($08), or BIN ($06) with specific aux type:
  * BIN ($06) Files:
    * Aux type $2000 or $4000 and 17 blocks are hi-res images.
    * Aux type $2000 or $4000 and 33 blocks are double hi-res images.
    * Aux type $5800 and 3 blocks are Minipix (Print Shop) images.
  * FOT ($08) Files:
    * Aux type $4000 or $4001 are packed hi-res/double hi-res images. ([#107](https://github.com/a2stuff/a2d/issues/107))
    * 17 block files are hi-res images.
    * 33 block files are double hi-res images.
* Font files must be type FNT ($07) and must be MGTK font resources. (This file type is officially reserved for Apple /// SOS font files, but unlikely to be confused.)

To preview files of other types (e.g. view a BIN file as text), you
can copy the appropriate preview handler (e.g. `SHOW.TEXT.FILE`) from
the `PREVIEW` folder to the `DESK.ACC` folder, and restart DeskTop. To
use them, select the file icon and then select the appropriate command
from the Apple menu.

### Notable Fixes
