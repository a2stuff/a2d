### Additional Desk Accessories

* This Apple

  * Eyes that follow the mouse. (#53)

* Run Basic Here
  * Launch BASIC.SYSTEM with PREFIX set to the current window's pathname. (#42)

Note that several of the new Desk Accessories will not work with older versions
of Apple II DeskTop/MouseDesk, due to dependence on new APIs.

The former "Show Text File" DA is now part of automatic preview
functionality (see below).


### Automatic Preview

Text and Graphics files with the correct file types can be previewed
without leaving DeskTop; select the file icon then select File > Open,
or double-click the file icon. Text files must be type TXT ($04).
Graphics files must be type FOT ($08).

To preview files of other types, you can copy the preview handlers
named `SHOW.TEXT.FILE` and `SHOW.IMAGE.FILE` from the `PREVIEW` folder
to the `DESK.ACC` folder, and restart DeskTop. To use them, select the
file, then select the appropriate command from the Apple menu.


### Notable Fixes

* Dates 00-39 are treated as 2000-2039; dates 100-127 are treated as 2000-2027. (#15)
* File > Quit returns to ProDOS 8 selector, and /RAM is reattached. (#3)
* SELECTOR.LIST created if missing. (#92)
* Prevent crash after renaming volume. (#99)
* Prevent crash with more than two volumes on a SmartPort interface. (#45)
* Startup menu will include Slot 2. (#106)

* Correct rendering issues with desktop volume icons. (#117)
* Prevent occasional rectangle drawn on desktop after window close. (#120)
* Empty directories can be copied/moved. (#121)
* Desk Accessories:
  * Date: Read-only on systems with a clock. On systems without a clock, date is saved for next session. (#30, #39)
  * Calculator: don't mis-paint when moved offscreen and other fixes. (#33, #34)
  * Sort Directory: don't need to click before sorting. (#17)

### Known Issues
