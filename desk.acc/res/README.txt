Apple II Desktop - Desk Accessories
===================================

Installation
------------

If using a physical Apple II with actual floppy disks, transfer the
DeskAccessories.po. file to a floppy using ADTPro. If using a floppy
emulator, copy the file to your storage medium.

1. Boot into Apple II Desktop.
2. Insert the disk with the desk accessories.
3. Drag the files into your A2.DESKTOP/DESK.ACC folder.
4. Reboot.

Tip: You can use the Sort Directory DA to order the files, which controls
the menu order:

* Open the A2.DESKTOP/DESK.ACC folder
* Hold Open-Apple and click on each file in the desired order
* Select Sort Directory from the Apple menu, and verify the order
* Restart

Show Image File
---------------
In Apple II Desktop, select an image file. Unfortunately, these are
hard to identify in A2D; they appear as a binary file (icon is <01>)
and are usually either 17 (single hi-res) or 33 (double hi-res) blocks
- you can check View > By Name or use Special > Get Info... to see the
size.

Then select Show Image File from the Apple menu. The image should
appear. If garbage appears, it was probably not an image file. You can
move the mouse pointer while the image is displayed. Click the mouse
button or press Escape to return to the DeskTop.


This Apple
----------
Select this item from the Apple menu to see an overview of the model
of computer, the CPU, an estimate of RamWorks memory expansion (if
present), and what cards can be identified in each slot.


Eyes
----
Select this for a demo showing two eyes that follow the mouse cursor.
The window can be moved and resized.
