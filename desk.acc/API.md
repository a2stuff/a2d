# Desk Accessory API

Desk Accessories for DeskTop have general access to the Mouse Graphics
Tool Kit MLI, ProDOS MLI, and DeskTop APIs. Special considerations for
DAs are documented here.

## File Format & Loading

Desk Accessories have a 4-byte header that define the size of Aux
memory (16-bit, little endian) and Main memory (16-bit, little-endian)
segments respectively.

* If non-zero in size, the Aux memory segment is loaded to Aux $800
* The Main memory segment (required) is loaded to Main $800

Since MGTK resides in Aux memory, resources (e.g. bitmaps) and
structs (e.g. Winfos and GrafPorts) *must* reside in Aux, so it is
typical to place these in the Aux segment.

Each segment can extend from $800 - $1C00, so $1400 bytes each.

Use these macros (from in
[../desktop/desktop.inc](../desktop/desktop.inc) to help define the
file structure:

```asm
    ;; Instantiate the file header
    DA_HEADER

    ;; Optional:
    DA_START_AUX_SEGMENT
    ;; Code and resources to load starting at $800 Aux
    DA_END_AUX_SEGMENT

    ;; Required:
    DA_START_MAIN_SEGMENT
    ;; Code and resources to load starting at $800 Main
    DA_END_MAIN_SEGMENT
```

The Aux memory segment is scoped as `aux`, to make cross-segment
references clearer. This is not done for the Main memory segment since
ca65 limitations with forward references to scopes make it awkward.

## Desk Accessory Execution Environment

After loading, the entry point at $800 Main is invoked. Once running,
memory from $800 to $2000 in both Main and Aux is available for use.

DeskTop and hence Desk Accessories execute with the following
bank state:

* Main memory banked in $200-$BFFF (`RAMRDOFF` + `RAMWRTOFF`)
* Aux ZP/LC banked in $0000-$01FF and $D000-$FFFF (`ALTZPON`)
* Language card bank 1 banked in $D000-$DFFF (`LCBANK1`)
* Text/hires screens not banked by `PAGE2` (`CLR80STORE`)

This bank state *must* be active for any DeskTop call, and at exit.

Remember that:

* Toolkit calls *must* reference params and resources in Aux (or the
    ZP)
* ProDOS MLI calls *must* reference params and buffers in Main

Simple DAs that operate on files with no UI (e.g. Sort Directory, Run
Basic Here) can reside entirely in Main memory and not use Aux at all.
DAs that do not operate on files can run almost entirely from Aux.
More complex DAs will typically do a mix of both.

DAs can use these macros to make cross-bank subroutine calls:

* `JSR_TO_MAIN addr` - call aux to main; A,X trashed, Y preserved
* `JSR_TO_AUX addr` - call aux to main; A,X trashed, Y preserved

Memory can be transferred using the standard `AUXMOVE` routine.

On exit, a DA *must* `RTS` back to the caller from Main memory, with
the previously described banking state.

### Execution from Main Memory

DAs can make ProDOS MLI calls using `JUMP_TABLE_MLI_CALL` macro. This
is required because DeskTop operates with Aux ZP/Stack/LC banked in,
and ProDOS requires Main ZP/ROM banked in. $1C00-$2000 is a good place
for an I/O buffer.

DAs can make MGTK calls using the `JUMP_TABLE_MGTK_CALL` macro, which
takes care of the required banking. Note that the referenced
parameters *must* reside in Aux memory. For static data or opaque
structures (e.g. bitmap, Winfos, GrafPorts, etc.) the code can simply
pass the address of the data in Aux memory. For data modified at
runtime (e.g. strings, events, etc.) it is necessary to copy the data
Main to Aux before and/or Aux to Main after the call using `AUXMOVE`.

Calls into other toolkits (Button TK, Line Edit TK) directly from Main
are not currently supported. (But this is straightforward to add, if
needed.)

### Execution from Aux Memory

DAs can make toolkit calls directly by using macros. The entry points
required by the macros are defined automatically by the
`DA_START_AUX_SEGMENT` macro.

* MGTK: use `MGTK_CALL`
* Button TK: use `BTK_CALL`
* LineEdit TK: use `LETK_CALL`

ProDOS MLI calls directly from Aux memory are _not supported_. DAs
running from Aux memory need to implement helper methods in Main which
they can call to do file operations, and any loaded data needs to
be proxied back to Aux memory using `AUXMOVE`.

## UI Lifecycle

See [Creating Applications and DeskTop Desk Accessories](../mgtk/MGTK.md#creating-applications-and-desktop-desk-accessories) for full details about the lifecycle of an MGTK-based application or desk accessory. In summary, though:

* Create window (`OpenWindow`)
* Draw everything
* Flush event queue (`FlushEvents`)
* Run an event Loop (`GetEvent`, and subsequent processing, per MGTK)
  * Call `JUMP_TABLE_YIELD_LOOP` in the loop so DeskTop can update the clock, etc.
  * Normal event processing per MGTK
  * Following a window drag/resize, a DeskTop call *must* be made:
    * `JUMP_TABLE_CLEAR_UPDATES` - redraw needed parts of windows and desktop (volume) icons.
* Destroy window (`CloseWindow`)
   * Call `JUMP_TABLE_CLEAR_UPDATES` to let DeskTop know it needs to redraw.


To perform the `JUMP_TABLE_XYZ` calls from Aux memory, use the `JSR_TO_MAIN` macro.

## Accessing Files

As a convenience, DAs are launched with the full path to the first
selected file at $220 Main. This applies to both Preview DAs (executed
automatically when a text/image/etc file is opened) and to DAs invoked
from the menu. If no file is selected, $220 is set to 0.

For more elaborate operations, e.g. on directories or multiple files,
the following DeskTop calls can be used:

* `JUMP_TABLE_GET_SEL_COUNT` - returns the number of selected icons in A
* `JUMP_TABLE_GET_SEL_WIN` - returns the window id holding the selection (0 if desktop) in A
* `JUMP_TABLE_GET_WIN_PATH` - called with window id in A, returns the path (in Aux LC1) in A,X
* `JUMP_TABLE_GET_SEL_ICON` - called with selection index in A, returns IconEntry (in Aux LC1) in A,X

At exit, a DA can request that a particular file icon be shown and
highlighted in DeskTop. This can be done by copying the full path to
`INVOKER_PREFIX` ($220 Main) and then executing:

```asm
        ;; Save the top of the stack
        pla
        tax
        pla
        tay

        ;; Inject a call to `JUMP_TABLE_SHOW_FILE`
        lda     #>(JUMP_TABLE_SHOW_FILE-1)
        pha
        lda     #<(JUMP_TABLE_SHOW_FILE-1)
        pha

        ;; Restore the top of the stack
        tya
        pha
        txa
        pha
```

## More Memory?

* If the DA will not be displaying DHGR graphics, or not be using MGTK
  for graphics, or will be full-screen, it can use DHGR page 1
  (Main+Aux $2000-$3FFF). On exit, it *must* reconstruct the desktop
  by calling:
    * MGTK's `MGTK::RedrawDeskTop` to redraw the desktop
    * MGTK's `MGTK::DrawMenuBar` to redraw the menu
    * DeskTop's `JUMP_TABLE_HILITE_MENU` to re-hilite the menu item
      that invoked it, since it will be re-inverted on return to
      DeskTop.
* If the DA uses the text or lores screens, it *must* save the visible
  bytes on entry and restore them on exit, and *must not* modify the
  screen holes.
* DAs can overwrite 10k of Main memory normally used for DeskTop code
  that isn't used while a DA is running (e.g. command logic). This is
  at `OVERLAY_10K_BUFFER` and the size is `kOverlay10KBufferSize`. To
  restore DeskTop, the DA *must* call DeskTop's `JUMP_TABLE_RESTORE_OVL`

See examples in the Screen Saver and Show XYZ File code.

## Gotchas

DeskTop's "alert" code uses Aux $E00-$1FFF as a "save buffer"
for the pixels overdrawn by the alert, so it can be quickly hidden
without requiring redraws. This leaves $800-$DFF free for resources,
but if an alert is shown memory over $E00 will be overwritten.
