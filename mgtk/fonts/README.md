# MouseGraphics Fonts

This is a collection of fonts that work with MGTK.

The `bin/convert_font.pl` tool can be used to convert a 768-byte HiRes
Character Generator (HRCG) font to MTGK format. Several are included
below.

The `bin/dump_font.pl` tool can be used to preview a font, displaying
an ASCII rendition of the pixels on the console.

If these are transferred to an Apple disk and changed to file type $07
(FNT) then the `SHOW.FONT.FILE` preview accessory can show them in
DeskTop.
