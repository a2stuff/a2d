# Apple IIc Plus Notes

## Accelerator

On some systems (IIgs, Mac IIe Card, Laser 128), the accelerator is temporarily turned off when performing paddle reads or playing sounds. This is not done on the Apple IIc Plus. For one thing, it's not necessary - the IIc Plus accelerator is already configured to slow for paddle and speaker accesses. For another, accessing the Cache Glue Gate Array (CGGA) to control the accelerator kicks the system out of double hires mode. Even if it is turned back on immediately, a visual glitch can occur for a few scan lines.

See Apple IIc Technical Reference Manual 2nd Ed. for more details.

@qkumba notes that since this is IIc Plus specific, VBL is available and the code could wait for the blanking interval before making CGGA calls, to avoid the glitching.

For posterity, here's code that does disable and conditionally re-enable the accelerator.

Requires a 2-byte `cgga_buffer`.
