;;; NORMFAST Disable/enable Apple II compatible accelerator
;;;
;;; Release 6 2017-10-05 Fix Mac IIe card check
;;;
;;; Release 5 2017-09-27 Add Macintosh IIe Card. Addon
;;; accelerators are now set blindly, so will access
;;; annunciators/IIc locations and may trigger the
;;; paddle timer.
;;; No plans for the Saturn Systems Accelerator which would
;;; require a slot search.
;;;
;;; Release 4 2017-09-06 Add Laser 128EX, TransWarp I, UW
;;;
;;; Release 3 2017-08-29 Change FASTChip partially back to
;;; release 1, which seems to work the way release 2 was
;;; intended?!
;;;
;;; Release 2 2017-08-27 change enable entry point, add Zip
;;; Chip, change setting FASTChip speed to disable/enable
;;;
;;; Release 1 2017-08-25 IIGS, //c+ and FASTChip
;;;
;;; WARNING: The memory location to set the accelerator
;;; speed may overlap existing locations such as:
;;;   annunciators or Apple //c specific hardware
;;;   paddle trigger
;;;
;;; Known to work: IIGS, //c+
;;; Theoretically: FASTChip, Laser 128EX, Mac IIe Card,
;;;   TransWarp I, trademarked German product, Zip Chip
;;;
;;; BRUN NORMFAST or CALL 768 to disable the accelerator.
;;; CALL 771 to enable the accelerator.
;;; Enabling an older accelerator may set maximum speed.
;;; Accelerators such as the FASTChip or Zip Chip can run
;;; slower than 1Mhz when enabled.
;;;
;;; NORMFAST is position independent and can be loaded most
;;; anywhere in the first 48K of memory.
;;; The ROMs must be enabled to identify the model of the
;;; computer.
;;;
;;; This was originally for the //c+ which is normally
;;; difficult to set to 1Mhz speed.
;;; The other expected use is to set the speed in a program.
;;;
;;; Written for Andrew Jacobs' Java based dev65 assembler at
;;; http://sourceforge.net/projects/dev65 but has portability
;;; in mind.

;;; 6502 opcodes are preferred to be friendly to the old
;;; monitor disassemblers

;;; addresses are lowercase, constant values are in CAPS
