# Contributing To The Effort

Contributions welcome! Preliminaries:

* Please re-read the [README](README.md) and pay attention to the Code of Conduct.
* Read the [Coding Style](CodingStyle.md) guide.

## Sub-Projects

1. Disassembly of the MouseGraphics ToolKit
   * Continue the effort to understand this powerful GUI library.
   * Make it relocatable, work on C bindings for cc65.
1. Disassembly of DeskTop itself
   * The core bits of DeskTop.
   * The various overlays.
   * The DiskCopy overlay is basically a stand-alone app. Could be fun.
1. Bug fixes
   * Try and tackle some of the bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/inexorabletash/a2d/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug-in-original).
   * Bug fixes will alter the binary, so should occur in branches. There's a `fixes` branch with some already.
1. Add new Desk Accessories
   * List of ideas in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/inexorabletash/a2d/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Desk+Accessories%22+label%3Aenhancement-for-new)
   * An ["Eyes"](https://github.com/inexorabletash/a2d/issues/53) DA would be a cool, quick demo.
   * A ["Control Panel"](https://github.com/inexorabletash/a2d/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Control+Panel+DA+Fodder%22) DA would be really neat.
