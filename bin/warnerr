#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Call with a command to execute. If the command outputs anything to
# stderr, this will return false (fail).
# Also color-codes such output as red.
#
# Workaround for: https://github.com/cc65/cc65/issues/1563
#
# Sample usage:
#     warnerr ca65 -o target.o target.s $<
#     warnerr ld65 -o target target.o
#
# Implementation notes:
# * The "3>&1 1>&2 2>&3" incantation swaps STDOUT and STDERR.
# * The "< <( ... )" incantation is bash process substitution.
