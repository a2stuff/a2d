## Background

The application started its life as **MouseDesk** by Version Soft. Apple Computer licensed the software and released it, at first as MouseDesk 2.0, then rebranded **Apple II DeskTop** as the initial [system software for the Apple IIgs](http://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za/system-applications) before 16-bit GS/OS replaced it. It still functions on 8-bit Apples, including the Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc Plus, Apple IIe Option Card for Macintosh, and the Laser 128 family.

Other GUI environments exist for the 8-bit Apples, including [GEOS](http://toastytech.com/guis/a2geos.html) (which includes productivity applications) and [Quark Catalyst](http://toastytech.com/guis/qcat.html). While Apple II DeskTop is more limited then GEOS, serving only as a file manager and application launcher, it follows more common interface paradigms and is better integrated with ProDOS.

## This Project

The goal of this project is to disassemble/reverse-engineer the suite with an eye towards understanding how it functions, fixing bugs, and adding functionality.

See the [Release Notes](RELEASE-NOTES.md) for a list of enhancements and fixes so far.
