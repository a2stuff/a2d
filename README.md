## Background

This application started its life as **MouseDesk** by Version Soft. It
is a mouse-driven Mac-like "Finder" GUI application for 8-bit Apples
and clones with 128k of memory, utilizing double hi-res monochrome graphics
(560x192), an optional mouse, and the ProDOS operating system.

Apple Computer acquired the software and released it - rebranded as
**Apple II DeskTop** - as the initial
[system software for the Apple IIgs](](http://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za/system-applications))
before 16-bit GS/OS replaced it. The rebranded version still functions
on 8-bit Apples, including the Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc Plus,
Apple IIe Option Card for Macintosh, and the Laser 128 family.

Other GUI environments exist for the 8-bit Apples, including
[GEOS](http://toastytech.com/guis/a2geos.html) (which includes productivity applications) and
[Quark Catalyst](http://toastytech.com/guis/qcat.html).
While Apple II DeskTop is more limited -
serving only as a file manager and application launcher - it is (subjectively)
more visually appealing and better integrated with ProDOS.

## This Project

The goal of this project is to disassemble/reverse-engineer the suite
with an eye towards understanding how it functions, fixing bugs, and
adding functionality.

See the [Release Notes](RELEASE-NOTES.md) for a list of enhancements and fixes so far.
