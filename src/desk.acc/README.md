# Preview Accessories

These files are a special class of Desk Accessory which reside in
the `MODULES` subdirectory relative to `DESKTOP` (next to `APPLE.MENU`).
These DAs will be invoked automatically for certain file types when
File > Open is run or the files are double-clicked.

* [Show Text File](show.text.file.s)
   * Handles text files (TXT $04). Original DA from MouseDesk, with fixes.
* [Show Image File](show.image.file.s)
   * Handles image files (FOT $08 and some BIN $06)
   * Supports Hires and Double Hires images, including compressed images
   * Supports MiniPix/PrintShop clip-art
* [Show Duet File](show.duet.file.s)
   * Handles Electric Duet music files ($D5/$D0E7)
* [Show Font File](show.font.file.s)
   * Handles MGTK font files (FNT $07)

The files can optionally be copied into the `APPLE.MENU` directory to
allow direct invocation from the Apple menu. This can be useful to
preview files of different file types e.g. image files saved as BIN
$06.

NOTE: ProDOS file type FNT $07 is reserved for Apple /// SOS font
files, but given their scarcity the type is re-used here.
