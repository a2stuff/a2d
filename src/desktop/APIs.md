# DeskTop APIs

There are two distinct API classes that are used within DeskTop and
Desk Accessories:

* Toolkits with MLI-style interfaces, including:
  * [MouseGraphics ToolKit](../mgtk/MGTK.md)
  * [Icon ToolKit](../toolkits/IconTK.md)
  * [LineEdit ToolKit](../toolkits/LETK.md)
  * [Button ToolKit](../toolkits/BTK.md)
  * [ListBox ToolKit](../toolkits/LBTK.md)
* DeskTop Jump Table - simple JSR calls starting at $4003 MAIN, no arguments
* Aux Entry Points

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## DeskTop Jump Table

Call from MAIN (RAMRDOFF/RAMWRTOFF); AUX language card RAM must be banked in. Call style:
```
   jsr $xxxx
```
Some calls take MLI-style parameters, or in registers.

> Routines marked with * are used by Desk Accessories.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_MGTK_CALL` *

MouseGraphics ToolKit call (main>aux).

Input: Follow `JSR` by call (`.byte`) and params (`.addr`), MLI-style.
Output: A=result

(Param data must reside in aux memory, lower 48k or LC banks.)

Use the `JUMP_TABLE_MGTK_CALL` macro (yes, same name) for convenience.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_MLI_CALL` *

ProDOS MLI call.

Input: Follow `JSR` by call (`.byte`) and params (`.addr`), MLI-style.
Output: C set on error, A = error code.

(Param data must reside in main memory, lower 48k.)

Use the `JUMP_TABLE_MLI_CALL` macro (yes, same name) for convenience.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_CLEAR_UPDATES` *

Tell DeskTop to process update events - i.e. redraw the desktop (volume icons) and directory windows as needed after move/resize/close. DeskTop will only redraw its own windows; Desk Accessories must redraw their own window.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_YIELD_LOOP` *

Yield during an event loop for DeskTop to run tasks. This allows the menu bar clock to be updated and similar infrequent operations.

Desk Accessories should call this (from main!) from their event loop unless they need to have total control of the system (e.g. screen savers). A good place to do this is just before a call to `MGTK::GetEvent`. Note that the current grafport may be modified during this call.

Yielding during further nested loops (e.g. button tracking, etc) can be done but is not worth the effort.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_ACTIVATE_WINDOW` *

Activate and refresh the specified window (A = window id)

#### `JUMP_TABLE_SHOW_ALERT` *

Show alert, with default button options for error number

Error number is in A - either a ProDOS error number, or a DeskTop `kErrXXX` error as defined in `desktop/desktop.inc`.

NOTE: This will use Aux $E00...$1FFF to save the alert background; be careful when calling from a Desk Accessory, which may run from the same area.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_SHOW_ALERT_PARAMS`

Show alert, with custom parameters.

A,X is the address of an `AlertParams` structure; see `../common.inc`.

NOTE: This will use Aux $E00...$1FFF to save the alert background; be careful when calling from a Desk Accessory, which may run from the same area.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_LAUNCH_FILE`

Launch file. Equivalent of **File > Open** command. Path in `INVOKER_PREFIX`.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_SHOW_FILE` *

Open the containing window for the specified file and select the file icon. Path in `INVOKER_PREFIX`.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_RESTORE_OVL` *

Restore from overlay routine

Routines are defined in `desktop/desktop.inc`.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_COLOR_MODE` *
#### `JUMP_TABLE_MONO_MODE` *

Set DHR color or monochrome mode, respectively. DHR monochrome mode is supported natively on the Apple IIgs, and via the AppleColor card and Le Chat Mauve, and is used by default by DeskTop. Desk Accessories that display images or exit DeskTop can can toggle the mode.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_RGB_MODE` *

Set DHR color or monochrome mode, based on control panel setting.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_RESTORE_SYS` *

Used when exiting DeskTop; exit DHR mode, restores DHR mode to color, restores detached devices and reformats /RAM if needed, and banks in ROM and main ZP.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_GET_SEL_COUNT` *

Get number of selected icons.

Output: A = count.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_GET_SEL_ICON` *

Get selected IconEntry address.

Input: A = index within selection.
Output: A,X = address of IconEntry.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_GET_SEL_WIN` *

Get window containing selection (if any).

Output: A = window_id, or 0 for desktop.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_GET_WIN_PATH` *

Get path to window.

Input: A = window_id.
Output: A,X = address of path (length-prefixed).

#### `JUMP_TABLE_HILITE_MENU` *

Toggle hilite on last clicked menu. This should be used by a desk accessory that repaints the entire screen including the menu bar, since when the desk accessory exits the menu used to invoke it (Apple or File) will toggle.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_ADJUST_FILEENTRY` *

Adjust case in FileEntry structure. If GS/OS filename bits are set, those are used. If the file type is an AppleWorks file, the auxtype bits are used. Otherwise, case is inferred.

Input: A,X = FileEntry structure.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_ADJUST_ONLINEENTRY` *

Adjust case in volume name. If GS/OS filename bits are set, those are used. Otherwise, case is inferred.

Input: A,X = volume name.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_GET_RAMCARD_FLAG` *

Returns Z=1/N=0 if DeskTop is running from its original location, and Z=0/N=1 if DeskTop was copied to RAMCard.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_GET_ORIG_PREFIX` *

If DeskTop was copied to RAMCard, this populates the passed buffer with the original prefix path (with trailing `/`). Do not call unless DeskTop was copied to RAMCard.

Input: A,X = Path buffer.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_BELL` *

Play the alert sound, as specified in settings.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_SLOW_SPEED` *

Slow system accelerator; see `../lib/speed.s` for notes.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_RESUME_SPEED` *

Resume system accelerator; see `../lib/speed.s` for notes.

#### `JUMP_TABLE_READ_SETTING` *

Load a byte from the persisted settings defined by `DeskTopSettings` in `../common.inc`.

Input: X = DeskTopSetting::* index
Output: A = value, X = unchanged (handy for loading multi-byte values)
